# CA-INSTALLER
This is the source code for the installer for Cubey's Adventures.

This recieves a TXT from my web server, which includes a link to the latest zip file, it then downloads the latest zip file, unzips it to the game folder, adds a shortcut and launches the game. Simple enough.

It's all commented if im correct.
