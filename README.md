# CA-INSTALLER
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/team-cubey/ca-installer/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/team-cubey/ca-installer)
This is the source code for the installer for Cubey's Adventures.

This recieves a TXT from my web server, which includes a link to the latest zip file, it then downloads the latest zip file, unzips it to the game folder, adds a shortcut and launches the game. Simple enough.

It's all commented if im correct.

## Can i use this?
You can use this for your own games, even without credit (would be nice though). though, no documentation is provided, please learn the code yourself or contact me on discord at Hubz#6283. I'll help out.
